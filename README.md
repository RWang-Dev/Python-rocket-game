# Python-rocket-game
This project was created as a final project in my freshman computer science class. Built directly in Visual Studio Code, the program features a simple pixilated game using Python Turtle graphics as a base, where the user has to control the spacecraft to avoid various asteroids.

The controls are simple: press the up, left, and right keys to move your rocket in said direction and try not to get hit by the asteroids for as long as possible.
There is a limited fuel supply, so move at your own risk.
